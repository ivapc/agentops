# Sessions vs Runs

Two top-level entries in the UI, two different jobs. (`/live` redirects to `/runs` for bookmarks.)

## The split

**Sessions — pure observability.**
The conversation history of an agent. Always read-only. Today it's reconstructed from telemetry; later it may come from a DB mirror, an external API, or a paste-in. The page doesn't care where spans come from, only that it gets them.

**Runs — the active / single-execution surface.**
One OTLP trace at a time (URL param `$runId` is typically the backend `trace_id`). The landing page (`/runs`) will host live-tail, streamed events, or “start an agent here” workflows. Until that lands, `/runs` stays empty-state; `/runs/$runId` is the standalone run viewer (`ConversationView`).

The internal unit stays a **`run`** (single trace slice). Completed work that shares a **`session`** id rolls up under **Sessions** instead of a universal “all runs” list today.

| | Sessions | Runs |
|---|---|---|
| Job | Read what happened (multi-run thread) | Watch / inspect one execution |
| Unit | A conversation (many runs) | One run |
| Read-only? | Always | Currently — not by design |
| Data origin (today) | Telemetry, joined by `session.id` / `gen_ai.conversation.id` / `ag_ui_thread_id` / agent-instance-hex fallback | Telemetry, one `trace_id` per page |
| Data origin (future) | + DB, external feeds | + live exporter stream, + direct invocation of an external agent |

A run that doesn't resolve to a session id (no attribute, no `invoke_agent` hex to fall back on) currently has no listing surface. Reach it directly as `/runs/$runId` (legacy `/live/$runId` redirects) until a runs list lands.

## Session detail (`/sessions/$sessionId`)

Default tabs: **`Conversation`** vs **`Spans`**. Search params use `view=spans`; legacy `view=trace` is still parsed as spans.

**Conversation tab (default).** Two-column.
- **Left** — `TurnsView` (`src/components/turns-view.tsx`): token-usage table (`# · Time · In · Out · Errs · Turn · Σ · Dur` + Total), the breakdown panel below (`System prompts · Tool definitions · Messages · Prompt cache · Total`) computed by `useBreakdowns` (`src/hooks/use-breakdowns.ts`) on top of `breakdownChat` in `src/lib/tokens.ts`, then one card per turn with status / cost / duration.
- **Right** — `ConversationView` (`src/components/conversation-view.tsx`): chat bubbles, paired tool cards, agent cards. Renders `ConversationEvent[]` from `src/lib/conversation.ts`.

**Spans tab.** Session span tree (`SessionInspectLayout`, `session-inspect-drawer.tsx`) + turn strip + span detail (`DetailPanel`). Hides naked `http` transport spans while keeping subtree rollups contiguous.

## Run detail (`/runs/$runId`)

Just the conversation, full width — `ConversationView` and nothing else. One run is one assistant turn; the aggregate-per-turn panel has nothing to chew on at this scale.

What's coming next here:
- **Live tail.** Spans appear in the conversation as they flush from the exporter — granularity is one span, not tokens.
- **Direct ingest.** An app POSTs events to us instead of going through OTel. Same render.
- **Initiate a run.** Send a prompt from the UI to a configured agent endpoint; the conversation that comes back is just another run.

The Spans/waterfall view can come back behind an opt-in if needed — not the default.

## List pages

Only `/sessions` is a list today. Toolbar pieces (`SearchInput`, `StatusPills`) plus `formatAgo` / `formatCost` / `truncateId` in `src/lib/format.ts` should be reused when `/runs` gains an active-queue / history list.

## Data fetching

Route loaders call `context.queryClient.ensureQueryData(...)` and routes read via `useQuery(...)`. Per-route `queryOptions` ship next to loaders (e.g. `sessions/-data.ts`, `runs/-data.ts`); stable keys live in `src/lib/query-keys.ts`.

## Where to extend

| You want to… | Edit |
|---|---|
| Show a new per-span field | `Span` in `src/lib/spans.ts`, then lift in `src/lib/classify-span.ts` (both dotted and underscore-flattened forms) |
| Add a new event kind in the chat (eval result, feedback, etc.) | New arm on `ConversationEvent` in `src/lib/conversation.ts`, render in `ConversationView` |
| Add a format helper | `src/lib/format.ts` — don't reinvent |
| Support a new tokenizer family | Extend `resolveFamily` in `src/lib/tokens.ts`. Lazy-load the encoder data |
| Add a new data source for Sessions (DB, external) | The session detail loader in `src/routes/sessions/$sessionId.tsx`. Page only consumes `Span[]`, so anything that yields spans works |
| Add live tail / direct ingest | `src/routes/runs/$runId.tsx`: replace the one-shot `runSpansQuery` fetch with a subscription that pushes spans into `ConversationView`. Lists can reuse `runSpansQuery` keys from `runs/-data.ts` or `listRecentTraces()` in telemetry |
